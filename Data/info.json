I won first place by developing <span class='inline bold'>Math Rain!</span> in <span class='inline'>Python PyQt5</span> with the motif of acid rain from the old Hancom tutoring program. <br /><br />However, I wanted to make a mobile app to solve the inconvenience of my daily life, not a computer program, and I wanted to make it public. At that time, my teacher gave me a flyer for the national high school club program presentation, and I developed a <a herf='https://github.com/INIRU/Nofy/tree/main' class='inline bold'>Nofy</a> using subway station <span class='inline bold'>WiFi BSSID</span> as a project leader, and I presented it to my high school club friends across the country and received a lot of praise. My 2021 was an important year for me to develop my capabilities and collaboration in team projects."

In fact, more juniors came to our club than I expected, and my teacher asked me if I would teach my knowledge to the juniors every Friday. I worked hard because I wanted to gain experience in teaching someone and because I think teaching someone is the best way to remember and learn, and it paid off. <br/><br/>However, I didn't neglect my own development. I upgraded the <a herf='https://github.com/INIRU/Nofy/tree/main' class='inline bold'>Nofy</a> I developed last year, improved the UI and performance, and presented it at the Korean Code Fair."
